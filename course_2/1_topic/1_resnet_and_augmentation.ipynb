PyTorch Lightning is a framework that simplifies your code needed to train, evaluate, and test a model in PyTorch. It also handles logging into [TensorBoard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html), a visualization toolkit for ML experiments, and saving model checkpoints automatically with minimal code overhead from our side. This is extremely helpful for us as we want to focus on implementing different model architectures and spend little time on other code overhead. Note that at the time of writing/teaching, the framework has been released in version 1.3. Future versions might have a slightly changed interface and thus might not work perfectly with the code (we will try to keep it up-to-date as much as possible). \n",

    "The [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) paper is one of the  [most cited AI papers](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/google-scholar-reveals-most-influential-papers-research-citations-twenty-twenty), and has been the foundation for neural networks with more than 1,000 layers. Despite its simplicity, the idea of residual connections is highly effective as it supports stable gradient propagation through the network. Instead of modeling $x_{l+1}=F(x_{l})$, we model $x_{l+1}=x_{l}+F(x_{l})$ where $F$ is a non-linear mapping (usually a sequence of NN modules likes convolutions, activation functions, and normalizations). If we do backpropagation on such residual connections, we obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial x_{l+1}}{\\partial x_{l}} = \\mathbf{I} + \\frac{\\partial F(x_{l})}{\\partial x_{l}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias towards the identity matrix guarantees a stable gradient propagation being less effected by $F$ itself. There have been many variants of ResNet proposed, which mostly concern the function $F$, or operations applied on the sum. In this tutorial, we look at two of them: the original ResNet block, and the [Pre-Activation ResNet block](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original ResNet block applies a non-linear activation function, usually ReLU, after the skip connection. In contrast, the pre-activation ResNet block applies the non-linearity at the beginning of $F$. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For very deep network, however, the pre-activation ResNet has shown to perform better as the gradient flow is guaranteed to have the identity matrix as calculated above, and is not harmed by any non-linear activation applied to it. For comparison, in this notebook, we implement both ResNet types as shallow networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the original ResNet block. The visualization above already shows what layers are included in $F$. One special case we have to handle is when we want to reduce the image dimensions in terms of width and height. The basic ResNet block requires $F(x_{l})$ to be of the same shape as $x_{l}$. Thus, we need to change the dimensionality of $x_{l}$ as well before adding to $F(x_{l})$. The original implementation used an identity mapping with stride 2 and padded additional feature dimensions with 0. However, the more common implementation is to use a 1x1 convolution with stride 2 as it allows us to change the feature dimensionality while being efficient in parameter and computation cost. The code for the ResNet block is relatively simple, and shown below:"

    "Finally, we can train our ResNet models. One difference to the GoogleNet training is that we explicitly use SGD with Momentum as optimizer instead of Adam. Adam often leads to a slightly worse accuracy on plain, shallow ResNets. It is not 100% clear why Adam performs worse in this context, but one possible explanation is related to ResNet's loss surface. ResNet has been shown to produce smoother loss surfaces than networks without skip connection (see [Li et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09913.pdf) for details).\n",
