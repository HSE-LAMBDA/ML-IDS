    "# 3-body problem\n",
    "In this notebook, we consider a classical 300-years old mathematical challenge. Isaac Newton has turned his attention to it after stating the gravity law for 2-body case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = G \\frac{M_1 M_2}{R^3}\\vec{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2-body case we have 3 degrees of freedom (independent variables) for each body, adding up to 6 in total, and 10 invariants of motion (energy, 3 momentum invariants, 3 angular momentum invariants, and 3 Lagrange-Rung-Lenz vectors), of which only 7 are in involution, so we can easily deduce the closed-form solution as the law written above. Things get less determined as we add the 3rd body. The number of degrees of freedom increases to 9; hence no closed-form solution can be derived. However, we can write down laws of motion in the form of ODE, get the evolution of $x(t)$, and compute the future state of the system. Intuitively 3 bodies might give a much richer repertoire of behavior, i.e., as 2 bodies get too close, they most likely collide without the 3rd one. In contrast, the 3rd may prevent the collision and produce quite fascinating dance patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity's sake, we'll consider the 2D case of 3 body system - such a system has enough degrees of freedom to remain \"unsolvable\" in terms of closed-form, but can be analyzed and solved using numerical calculations. Interestingly enough, this system of equations for different initial conditions can produce a variety of different kinds of motion: periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic. The former kind happens as the system gets to precisely the same initial conditions after a specific time interval referred to as _period_. The chaotic sort of motion is characterized by high dependency on the initial conditions, i.e., the small change in the conditions may lead to drastically different states in the future. Such unpredictability may happen due to close contact of two bodies when forces might get too large, and small differences in motion may lead to different trajectories. The study of such chaotic behaviors gave rise to a whole new branch of science called [_chaos theory_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the following cases:\n",
    "- Sun-Earth-Jupiter (periodic)\n",
    "- Periodic orbits (periodic)\n",
    "- Kepler-16 binary star system (periodic)\n",
    "- Chaotic system (chaotic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal would be to understand what system stability is and how do chaotic regimes differ from stable ones. "

Since the discovery of gravitational waves, we can observe gravitational patterns emitted by distant space objects. However, the collapsing black-stars are rather rare events.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) is always a good source of inspiration. Also, before concluding, it worths mentioning the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07291) by Breen P. et al. that improved accuracy and speed of ODE solving engine by training a neural net to find a good-enough solution with lightning speed."
